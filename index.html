<h2 class="coding"> Coding <h2>
	<p> So whats coding you must now whats coding but anyways heres whats coding.  Coding (also called programming) is how we communicate with computers. It allows us to create everything from simple websites to advanced artificial intelligence. Here’s a deeper look:

1. What is Coding?
Coding is writing instructions in a language that a computer understands. These instructions tell the computer what to do, like:

Displaying a website
Running a mobile app
Controlling a robot
Processing data
2. How Does It Work?
Computers don’t understand human languages. Instead, they understand machine code (binary: 1s and 0s). Coding uses programming languages that humans can write and understand, which then get converted into machine code.

3. Popular Programming Languages
There are many programming languages, each used for different purposes:

Python – Easy to learn, used in web development, AI, and automation.
JavaScript – The language of the web; makes websites interactive.
C++ – Used in game development and high-performance software.
Java – Common in mobile apps (especially Android).
HTML & CSS – Used to structure and style web pages.
4. Why Learn Coding?
Creativity – Build games, apps, and websites.
Problem-Solving – Develop logical thinking skills.
Career Opportunities – Many jobs need coding skills.
Automation – Write scripts to do tasks automatically.
5. How to Start?
If you’re interested, here are a few ways to begin:

Try online platforms like Scratch (for beginners), Code.org, or Khan Academy.
Learn Python, since it's beginner-friendly.
Experiment with small projects, like making a simple game.</p>
